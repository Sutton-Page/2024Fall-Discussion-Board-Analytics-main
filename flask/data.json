It iterates through a range of values or a collection, performing the same operation on each element. A while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known, and it continues to execute as long as a given condition remains true. Finally, the do-while loop is similar to the while loop but guarantees that the loop will execute at least once, as the condition is checked after the loop\u2019s body is executed.
